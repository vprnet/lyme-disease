            <p>Forty years ago Lyme Disease didn't even have a name. Today, the neurodegenerative disease <span class="stronger">infects up to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html" alt="Link to CDC press release containing infection estimates">300,000 annually</a> and has greatly expanded its range</span> beyond the small Connecticut town where it was first identified in 1975. While the data doesn't go that far back, the numbers from the last 15 years paint an alarming picture of skyrocketing infection rates and a disease on the march.</p>
            <p>The story of the growth of Lyme Disease is really the story of the deer tick, the primary vector for the disease and the beneficiary of a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582486/" alt="link between climate change and lyme disease expansion">warming climate</a> and <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/ecoinf/lyme.jsp" alt="National Science Foundation resource illustrating the connection between forest fragmentation and lyme disease incidence">increasingly fragmented forests</a>. Where the deer tick and its <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html#blacklegged" alt="CDC reference to rodents being the primary vector of the deer tick">small mammal hosts</a> are found, so too is Lyme Disease.</p>

            <h3>What About The Rest Of The Country?</h3>
            <div class="section_explanation">
                <p>Lyme Disease is largely restricted to the <strong>Northeast</strong>, the <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong> and the <strong>Upper Midwest</strong>, with <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Lyme/stats/" alt="Lyme Disease stats from the CDC">95% of cases coming from just 13 states</a>. <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> has the most cases every year with over 5,000 probable cases in 2012. Outside of the Northeast cluster <strong>Wisconsin</strong> has the largest number of probable cases in 2012 with 1766.</p>
                <p>While the deer tick's range extends into the <strong>South,</strong> Lyme Disease hasn't proliferated in the region the way that it has in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. This is <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html#blacklegged" alt="Explanation of disconnect between black legged ticks range and the Lyme Disease map">due to different feeding habits</a> of the ticks in that part of their range.</p>
                <p>Since the data on reported cases is sourced by state of residence, not state of exposure, it is difficult to determine the exact origin of many of the cases. It is reasonable to assume that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html" alt="CDC note on data reliability">over-reporting occurs in the disease's non-endemic areas</a>, such as the <strong>West</strong>.</p>

            <h3>A Note About The Data</h3>
            <div class="section_explanation">
                <p>Due to reporting methods and the limitations of surveillance data, discrepancies between figures exist, even in this report, specifically between Vermont case numbers between the New England section and the Vermont section.</p>
                <p>In the table of New England states, the number of cases in 2012 is reported as 386 while in the map of Vermont counties, the 2012 figure is listed as 367. The figure in the table represents the number of <em>confirmed</em> cases in Vermont, regardless of origin. In the map of Vermont, the figure used is the number of <em>confirmed and probable</em> cases of Vermont origin.</p>
                <p>Since more accurate information eliminating cases of unknown origin was available for Vermont, that data was used to provide the most accurate picture of Vermont's Lyme Disease statistics. The same data wasn't available for all New England states, so in comparing Vermont to the other New England states, the more general figures were used.</p>
                <p>For more on the complexities and limitations of this data, see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html" alt="CDC explanation of the limitations of surveillance data">this CDC explanation</a>.</p>
